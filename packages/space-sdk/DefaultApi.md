Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**register**](DefaultApi.md#register) | **POST** /register | Register New Agent


# **register**
> Register201Response register()

Creates a new agent and ties it to a temporary Account.  The agent symbol is a 3-14 character string that will represent your agent. This symbol will prefix the symbol of every ship you own. Agent symbols will be cast to all uppercase characters.  A new agent will be granted an authorization token, a contract with their starting faction, a command ship with a jump drive, and one hundred thousand credits.  > #### Keep your token safe and secure > > Save your token during the alpha phase. There is no way to regenerate this token without starting a new agent. In the future you will be able to generate and manage your tokens from the SpaceTraders website.  You can accept your contract using the `/my/contracts/{contractId}/accept` endpoint. You will want to navigate your command ship to a nearby asteroid field and execute the `/my/ships/{shipSymbol}/extract` endpoint to mine various types of ores and minerals.  Return to the contract destination and execute the `/my/ships/{shipSymbol}/deliver` endpoint to deposit goods into the contract.  When your contract is fulfilled, you can call `/my/contracts/{contractId}/fulfill` to retrieve payment.
